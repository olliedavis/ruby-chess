This is the Final Project of the The Odin Project's Ruby Programming Branch before moving on to Databases and Ruby On Rails. 

This is definitely the biggest project I have worked on so far. It took me exactly one month (3 / 4 hours a day) from beginning to end but I did take a few days off to revisit some older projects in the middle. 

I tried to keep it as DRY and clean as possible. This meant that a lot more methods were created than I usually would create but they all had one thing to do each. This was also the first time I have started using Modules which really helped with keeping it organised. 

I feel like I have made a lot of progress with my learning with this project so I am very glad I did it. If I was to do it all again, I'd would likely focus more on the Piece classes and have them store their individual locations, rather than having methods pull their location each time. This might be something I revisit down the line. 

Also, I have never really played Chess before so this is certainly a fun way to learn.
